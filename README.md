To Start this Project you will first need to connect your locally downloaded project to a MongoDB database and then create .env file.
This is my env file looks like:

NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI= **DATABASE CONNECTION**
JWT_SECRET=abc123

After that is finished you will need to do npm install inside the frontend folder and then in the root folder and when that is finished you can run it with npm run dev
